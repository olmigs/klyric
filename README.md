## Ladder

This exercise is originally from Jeff Tweedy, from his _How To Write One Song_:

1. Select 10 verbs or adjectives related to a specfic noun (e.g. construction, desert, mayor).
2. Generate 10 nouns based on your current surroundings.
3. Link each random verb or adjective to one of your special nouns.
4. Create a poem or song; for each line, use one of your word combinations.
